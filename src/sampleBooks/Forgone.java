  public static String firstChapter = "Darkness. It’s the absence of light in the earth’s hidden caverns. It’s the absence of hope found in the depths of loneliness. It’s the absence of self for a girl without any meaningful memories.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I am that girl without memories, without hope, without light. I am no one in nowhere, and I have nobody.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I rub my sleeve across my cheek, but the tears are long dry at this point. Instead, I trade one smudge of dirt for another, though without even a sliver of light, it’s impossible to say whether the trade is an improvement.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Forcing deep breaths, I pull my legs closer to my chest, allowing my hair to drape across my knees. How’d I end up in this cave? And how long have I been here? \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Waking up in cold, pitch blackness is literally the worst thing I can remember happening to me. And yes, I can honestly say literally since my memory spans back no more than two hours.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Maybe “waking up” is the wrong way to say that. Did I truly wake up or just somehow become aware I was here? The likeliest scenario is that I fell in this cave and hit my head, causing my amnesia. But as far as I can tell, I have no trauma, no wounds, no headaches. It’s almost as if there was never unconsciousness at all, just a memory leak until there was just the shadow of a teenage girl wandering around in a cavern. It’s a horror movie, and I’m the star… I think.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "And so here I am, seated on rock, surrounded by rock. In the dark. Alone. That initial panic—that overwhelming terror—it’s long since over, replaced by something more dreadful. Defeat, maybe?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "While darkness blankets the rocks around me, it is a darkness of the soul that washes over my body, constricting my lungs and contracting my muscles. I have nobody to help me, nobody to comfort me, nobody to scream at for leaving me in this nightmare. And without my memory, I can’t even be mad at myself.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I’d like to say I’m not one to give up, but I have no identity to measure against. All I can say about what kind of person I am is what I’m doing right now, and it sure looks like someone who has given up—unless I don’t.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Help!” I croak. My voice still isn’t rested from the strain of screaming that word earlier, but my fingers aren’t ready to start tracing the rocky walls again. I don’t want to resume fumbling through the darkness. But yelling this word, that is something I can still do.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny?!” comes the response, and my veins pulse with excitement. Someone is in this cave too. And Ginny—it’s my name! They know my name! I know my name.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Now that I’ve reclaimed my name, memories fall into place like seeds scattered across soil, taking root. My favorite color is aqua. I like my oatmeal flavored with cocoa and sugar. I remember scooping sand with a hand shovel and dumping it in a small bucket as a child.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "And yes, my name is Ginny. But even with these returned memory fragments, so much is still missing. I remember eating a chocolate chip cookie my grandma gave me, but her face and name elude me.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Help! Please help!” I yell back without a clue as to who they are. But they know me, and that’s enough. Even if they didn’t know me, I’d still be thrilled at any response. Maybe they know the way out! Maybe they have a flashlight!\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny, we’re coming!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Please hurry!” It’s all I can think to say.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We will, Ginny! We will!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My lungs churn out shallow breaths, but unlike the panicked breathing from before, this is the result of something I’ve been yearning for: hope.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "With this surge of hope, another restored memory lodges itself in my mind, this time of a woman—my grandma, definitely my grandma again—wearing a jumpsuit. No, it’s a techsuit. She is demonstrating a techsuit. The same kind of techsuit I’m wearing now.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My mind strains at the specifics of the memory, desperate to remember how any of the functionality works. And then I remember. My fingers tickle the fibers on the underside of each sleeve, beginning at the elbow out to the wrist. The motion activates microbulbs embedded at the cuffs below my wrists. And voila! Light! The beam isn’t particularly strong, but that’s to be expected with lumitech so small it’s embedded in clothing. \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I raise my hands and chase long shadows as they dance across the walls. This place is just as I feared: a narrow rock tunnel clothed in a drab gray. My fingers already explored the craggy surface; I didn’t need a light to know that part. But the ground, while a little bumpy, is relatively smooth, almost like this cave was made for human travelers. For a place reeking of primal, raw creation, that aspect seems completely unnatural. A chill runs down my spine.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I’m coming too!” I shout. No sense in hanging around here.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I stand, my muscles renewed, and use my new lights to guide my way. Sure wish I’d had these before.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I snake my way through the cave, careful but quick. Each time I arrive at a fork in my path, I call out and wait for a reply. Their response is my guide, and each step I take is one that is closer to the others.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Whoa. What’s this?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I exit my tunnel into a large room, the first of its kind I’ve entered. Instead of the narrow walls I’ve faced previously, this feels downright spacious, maybe two dozen feet wide and multiple times longer, like a hollow whale. With the extra space, tension seeps out of my muscles—tension I didn’t even realize I had. Even the air seems less stale and musty.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The far end lies enshrouded in darkness, my light not strong enough to pierce at that distance. Surely there must be another tunnel on that side, right? I heard the voices. If they weren’t coming from this room, they had to come from beyond it.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I inch along the wall, suddenly wary of this room. The tunnels were restricting, yes, but I knew what surrounded me. There’s too much I can’t see here, even with my light.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I’m not afraid of the dark, but my emotions missed the memo.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "An entryway comes into view, and I release a breath. And I glide into the new tunnel, grateful to be back in another tunnel, regardless of how musty it is. I mean, I know it was just my imagination running wild, but the whale room started creeping me out.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Static buzzes behind me, and my veins pulse faster. Definitely tech—has to be the others. Were there multiple entryways to that room? I didn’t check all of it, got a little scared. I hadn’t called out again to make sure I was going the right way. I could have missed them. \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny,” a hoarse voice says in the room behind me. Static sizzles through the air again, closer this time.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My heels spin, and I extend my trembling wrists back toward the whale room, the light bouncing around the rocky entryway. It’s them, right? The others? There’s no need to be nervous.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Hello?” I try with an uncertain voice, sliding back into the room. But there’s nobody.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Hello?” I say again, this time louder. Still nothing. The room is empty.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I shine my lights around. They still don’t reach to the far end of the whale room, but they do expose another entryway I missed before.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Hello?!” I yell as I creep toward this third passage.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny? We’re still coming!” comes the shouted response—from the tunnel I just left. So who called my name from this room? Who caused that static with their tech?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I approach the third entryway again. Did whoever call me go through there?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I wipe my trembling arms from side to side, and shadows shake across the walls. Deeper into this new tunnel, I venture. I need to know what else is in here—what must be in here.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A large figure with a shadowy cloak steps around the bend, blocking my path. A gasp escapes my lips, and my extended arms jolt in alarm, spraying light across the shadowman’s black fabric, its coarse texture absorbing my light’s brightness. I force my wrists higher, and the beam extends straight into the hood and exposes—nothing! The intensity of the darkness somehow masks the shadowman’s face even with my lumitech pointing directly at it. It’s a terror, the exact personification of how I imagine death.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The figure lunges toward me, and I scream—the full-on blood-curdling kind, shriller than any I’ve ever released. Fire surges through my veins, burning my face and igniting my muscles. Before the shadowman can reach me, I spin on my heels and bolt as its handless sleeve lunges for me. I blitz back through the tunnel toward the whale room.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The cool air whips past my face, catching my hair and sending it sailing behind me. I hold my right hand in front of me to keep my techsuit’s light ahead of me to illuminate my path, but at this speed, the cuff’s microbulbs wobble as each step pounds stone. Dust hangs in the air, but it swirls around me as I whiz by.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Rushing back into the whale room, I glance behind, twisting my left wrist for light. How close is it?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Big mistake. My foot strikes a rock, and I slam to the ground, knocking the wind out of my lungs. My arms push to get up, but I struggle to move, gasping for breath. Tears drip down my cheeks as I try to force any air down my throat.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I flip my arm around, casting the lumitech beam into the darkness, dreadfully awaiting the shadowman to descend upon me. The dust swirls around in the light, still stirred up by my run and moistening in my mouth. My heart pulses, pounding my ribs at double speed.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny! What happened? Are you okay?” The calls echo through the tunnel and reverberate into the whale room. Whoever—whatever—that hooded figure was, there are still the others, people who apparently know who I am, who know me by name.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Except that the shadowman called me by name as well, didn’t it? If I don’t have my memories, can I really trust someone just because they know my name? Details about the cave jump out at me: the relatively smooth floors, the numerous tunnels of even widths, the absence of any open areas other than this room. It’s all so unnatural, and I can’t shake the feeling that something more complicated—something more intentional—is going on.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Footsteps echo through the tunnel of the second entryway, voices getting louder.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Come on, lungs! It’s time to run. Now! I struggle to my feet and scramble toward the first entryway, the tunnel I originally came through. There are others in this cave, and with my memories gone, there’s only one thing I know for certain: I’m alone.";

    "\r\n" + 
    "The rocky walls rush past me. As I near the entryway, my hand scrapes against the wall’s jagged edge, leaving a white scratch, accompanied by a searing pain. I pull it in and hold it close to my chest. A groan rumbles through my throat. Great, now I’ve got this on top of my diaphragm spasms. Can I outrun them without the ability to take a deep breath? All I need is one minute to recuperate, but it’s one minute I don’t have.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Wait—the wall juts out here, creating an alcove of sorts. It scratched my arm—thanks for that, wall—but it also creates an alcove of sorts, a barrier. I dive behind it and brush both hands against the undersides of my sleeves, extinguishing the lumitech. A moment of near darkness engulfs me before lights burst into the room on the far side behind me. They’re here.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Tucking my arms and legs close, I lean deeper into the alcove. Yes, I’m completely visible on one side, but as long as nobody looks behind themselves when they pass, this hideaway is good enough.\r\n" +

Let’s go!” As she ends, footsteps from one of the boys echo from the tunnel where I saw the shadowman. Something inside me wants to jump up and warn him not to go that way, but they’re probably working together. And even if they aren’t, it’s better the shadowman gets him than me.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The girl rushes past my alcove, wasting no time and disappearing into the tunnel. The other boy follows, but his jog turns into a shuffle before he stops. His head cocks, and he keeps his flashlight forward as he peers into a dark corner of the room. I’m exposed from this angle, but it’ll be fine as long as he doesn’t completely turn around. My hand still stings, so I bite my sleeve to force myself to hold my breath.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The boy’s broad-shouldered back—carrying a red backpack—faces me, though his head is turned just enough for me to appreciate his firm jaw and dark skin. Looks to be about my same age too. He has cuff-mounted lumitech like mine—in fact, it looks like he’s wearing the same kind of techsuit I am. His arms drop to his side, the lights pointed straight at the ground. He must not be peering at anything. He’s listening!\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I stifle a gasp, but his face points the same direction. He glances down the tunnel where the other boy went, but then his head pivots like a weathervane in the wind, facing my direction. His eyes shine like marbles. But how? Maybe bionic lenses? I’ve never seen any like that before.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Although his arms remain at his side, sending his lumitech’s beams straight at the ground, his eyes fixate on me. My muscles tense. It has to be coincidence. There’s not enough residual light to give me away at this distance, is there?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "He whips up his left arm, and light floods around me. “She’s in here!” he shouts.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I launch out of my crouch and rush around the alcove, brushing my sleeves’ undersides as I go to activate the lights. So much for hiding. I dash toward the other side of the whale room.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny, wait!” Marble Eyes shouts. “What are you doing?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I pause and glance back. He’s frozen in place. So he wasn’t expecting me to run? Maybe he’s right: what am I doing? “Stay away,” I warn, just in case. I need to figure this out. I back up, closer to the tunnels in case I need to run.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny,” a voice says behind me. The shadowman! I jerk back and throw a punch. My fist connects solidly—not with the shadowman, but with the other boy square in the eye.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Without a flinch, his hand comes down and slaps my arm, clamping his hand around my wrist. “What was that for?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Let go!” I shriek, tugging on my arm to free it. No luck. He only tightens his grip.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny, what’s wrong?” he asks. He’s Asian—Chinese, I think—with dark eyes and black hair.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Just let me go!” I twist my wrist, freeing my arms from his grip, and I lean in with a hard shove, toppling us both to the stone and forcing him to bear the impact worsened by our combined weight. Without so much as a grunt, he rolls over, but before he can pin me, I scramble away on all fours. I place one foot on the ground to launch up and into a run, but his hands wrap around my ankle, and my takeoff only sends me slamming back down against the cool stone.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“She’s disoriented,” Marble Eyes says, catching up to us. The girl is with him now.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Yeah, I am,” I say. “I have no idea who you guys are.” I kick, but Black-haired Boy keeps a grip on my ankle.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The girl smirks and traces a finger down the left side of her face. “Didn’t recognize me without the scar, did you?” She stands tall with a high chin and intense eyes seated in a face frame by dirty blonde hair.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Come on, Ginny,” Black-haired Boy says, “come on, we’re your friends.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "This isn’t how you treat friends.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Just let go! I don’t remember anything” I scream.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Black-haired Boy’s grip loosens in an instant. “Anything? But why? How?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I scramble back to my feet, but I don’t bolt again. If they wanted to harm me, they would’ve already. They haven’t even blocked me off from the nearest exit. Maybe I was a little hasty in assuming these people were my enemies. Even so, none of their faces are familiar, nor do they trigger new memories like hearing my name did.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We’re all dressed similarly, wearing sleek techsuits all equipped with lumitech. They all have red backpacks, and I don’t, but Black-haired Boy has two. Could the second one be…?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny, we’re your applicant group,” Black-haired Boy says. Purple lines are forming around his eye. I hit him harder than he let on.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I shake my head. “I don’t know what that means.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“The assessment? Glee?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Sorry,” I say, shrugging.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Black-haired Boy starts pacing. “I don’t get it. How is this possible? I mean, your legs...” he says, pointing to Marble Eyes, “and your scar...” He nods at the girl.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Yeah, thanks,” she says, rolling her eyes. “But really, isn’t it obvious?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Marble Eyes tilts his head. “You are talking about forgones?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“What? You’re saying that’s why she lost her memory? But why would anyone do that?” Black-eyed Boy says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn raises her eyebrows and nods. “Doesn’t the first pact make more sense now?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Whoa, whoa,” I say, trying to catch up. “What are forgones?” The emphasis is on the first syllable—strange. However, the pronunciation doesn’t feel wrong on my tongue, though I can’t match the word up with a meaning that makes sense.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“You don’t want to know,” the girl says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I thrust my light in her face. “I’ll decide that, thank you!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Black-haired Boy opens his mouth but hesitates, pursing his lips back together as he breathes in. “Let’s start over, Ginny. I’m Ren.” His voice carries a calm tone, and a sympathetic smile stretches across his face. That might melt other girls, but it won’t work on me. He extends his hand.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I peer at him, sizing him up, complete with that stupid smile and perfect black eye. “If we already know each other, why are we shaking hands?”\r\n" + 
    " \r\n" + 
    "Ren shrugs. “From your point of view, it’s sort of like we’re meeting for the first time, right? I thought it’d be polite.”\r\n" + 
    " \r\n" + 
    "“It would be more polite to tell me why we’re stuck in a cave. And why are we all wearing matching techsuits? Is that my backpack you’re holding?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren sighs and finally withdraws his hand, apparently convinced that I’m not going to shake it. That only took about twenty seconds too long. “Yes. Yes, it is. Here.” He holds out the backpack to me.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Wait,” the girl says, snatching it from Ren. She unzips a pocket and fishes for something before giving the pack to me.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I take it and rummage inside. My fingers brush the coarse fabric of a full-sized, lightweight hammock. What are we doing with hammocks in a cave? I also find a collapsible canteen, three long glass tubes containing compressed toilet wipes—thank goodness for those!—and a bunch of sealed plastic bags of preserved food.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“What did you take out?” I ask. “Isn’t that mine?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "She holds up two patches just a few inches wide. A small aqua-colored button sits in the center of each one. The others all have similar patches attached to their collarbones on either side of their necks. Sure enough, mine are absent, though attachment modules are there. “They’re triggers,” she explains. “Yes, they’re yours. No, you can’t have them—not until you know what’s at stake once you press them. I’m Dawn, by the way.” \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Okay, Dawn,” I say, drawing out her name, “a trigger—regardless of what it’s for—sounds like it might be good to have with a hooded figure roaming the tunnels.” I point to the tunnel where I encountered the shadowman. The others have all remained closer to it than I have throughout this conversation, a detail I haven’t ignored.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren spins around. “What, in there?” he says with a quiver in his voice. \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn edges closer to me. “The others, maybe?” She turns my direction. “But a hood, you say?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Yes,” I respond, “with only blackness where its face should be. And it spoke my name.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The tension drains from Dawn’s countenance. Her gaze drops to the ground while she shakes her head. “Gregory,” she mutters. She slips off her backpack and takes out the hammock. “Was the hood like this?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“No! It wasn’t anything like that. And didn’t you just hear me? The thing had no face!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren frowns. “Maybe it just looked dark? It’s hard to see without good light.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“It was terrifying,” I retort. “And I saw it just before I ran into you three. I’m surprised you didn’t see it yourself.” I nod to Ren.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren bites his lip while Marble Eyes furrows his brow. Dawn only shrugs before calling out, “Gregory! Is that you?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“You don’t believe me,” I whisper.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "They all ignore my comment, but thankfully, the shadowman doesn’t respond to her shout either.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn glances at the others. “He probably ran off.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“But why would he do that, considering the second pact?” Marble Eyes says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren nods. “He’s got a point.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“How should I know? It’s Gregory we’re talking about,” Dawn says, but her smile looks forced.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Look,” I say, “let’s just get out of here. I’m freaking out a little bit.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Little bit” is an understatement.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We will, we will,” Ren says. “But we need to find the rest of our group.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I release a sigh in exasperation. “But there’s a creepy hooded figure wandering around! Wouldn’t it be better if we got out and then got some help?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The three of them share a look, lips pursed.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“That’s not how this works,” Dawn says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren points at me. “She has no idea what’s going on. We need to tell her something.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Marble Eyes nods, his gaze fixed on Ren.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn shakes her head. “You know we can’t.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“At least the second pact.” Ren’s finger moves from me to Dawn. “And we need to tell her we don’t know the way out.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My mouth drops wide open. “What?! Nobody knows the way out?” \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn rolls her eyes. “Okay, yeah, good. Way to freak her out. Go ahead then with the second pact.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren turns back to me. “All of us—and that includes you—made a promise to find each other as soon as we could once we got in here. We can’t leave until we do that. We’re still missing three.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Once we got in here?” I ask. “What is this place?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“A cave, obviously,” Dawn says, but her eyes flash a warning to the other two.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Keep up with the lies,” I say, “but there’s something going on here you’re not telling me. So let me ask you this: are they even in here? Why haven’t they been shouting back this whole time when we were calling out to each other?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Look,” Dawn says, “there have been a few things we didn’t expect—like your memory loss. But the others are in here.” Her eyes flit about into the darkness. “Somewhere.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Why not be looking for both the exit and the rest of our group at the same time?” Marble Eyes says. “Whichever we find first, great! Then we keep looking for the other.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "That makes sense. And if we find the way out first, I’ll make my exit. Do I really need to follow a promise I don’t even remember making? “Yeah,” I say. “It’s not like it matters what we’re looking for anyway. It’s like a maze in here.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren’s snaps his fingers. “That’s it—a maze. Whenever we get to a fork, we turn right.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Or left,” Dawn says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren nods. “Or left. It doesn’t really matter. We just need to stick to it. Might not be the shortest way out, but we’ll get there.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“It’s a plan then. When we have a choice, we go left.” She turns to Ren. “Nice black eye, by the way. It suits you.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Yeah, I bet,” Ren grumbles.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn picks her pack off the ground and slides her arms through each strap. She raises her wrist, pointing the light at the craggy ceiling. “I’ll go first since I’m the lightbearer.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Marble Eyes nods to his own wrists. “Are we not all lightbearers?” he whispers.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn proceeds toward the tunnel—the same one where I saw the shadowman. She offers no response to his remark. Didn’t she hear? Or she chose to ignore it?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Marble Eyes leans toward me. “I’m Angaza, by the way.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Thanks,” I say.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza shuffles behind Dawn. Ren’s eyes shift from Dawn and Angaza back to me, an inquisitive look on his face.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I’m next,” I say. There’s no way I’m going last, not when there’s a freaky shadowman haunting the cavern. And I’m definitely not sticking to my lonesome if I don’t have to.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren smiles, and it really does come across genuine. He motions to the others. “Of course.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "As eager as everyone is to tromp down that tunnel, it’s clear nobody believes what I said about the shadowman.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We pass through the entryway, and I hold my breath, my muscles tense. But no shadowman appears.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“See?” Dawn says, glancing back at me. “Nothing to worry about.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "There’s still plenty to worry about.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I flit my light around, anxious to dispel the darkness. Jagged, rocky, lifeless walls creep into view only to disappear back into the blackness. Each step I take is burdened with anxiety that we might be venturing further and further into the shadowman’s lair.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Should I have taken a different path alone? Can I even trust these guys? Doubts keep creeping up, constantly plaguing me. There’s obviously safety in numbers. When I look at the situation analytically, I made the right choice to tag along with a group that has a better handle on what’s going on. But still, I can’t help wondering if every decision I make is the wrong one. There are so many unknowns, and missing most of my memory doesn’t help.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The next two hours involve a lot of walking but not a lot of answers. Questions about why we’re in this cave are met with shrugs at best.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“It’s not that we don’t know,” Ren finally says. “It’s that we’re not sure we should say.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I roll my eyes—yes, literally roll them. “Oh, right. I wouldn’t want to know. The first pact. Blah blah blah.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn halts abruptly and pivots in place. “Look, you want to know where we are?” She says, her voice laced with anger.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The expression on her face makes my jaw clench. I raise my hand, finger pointed straight at her. “Yeah, actually. Did it only take five hundred questions to finally figure that out?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza, stuck in-between us, tries to step aside, though he can’t go far in this tunnel.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn, head held high, glares down at my finger. Her lips tighten as her nostrils flare. “Why don’t you see for yourself?” she says calmly. She backs against the wall like Angaza to let me go ahead.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I leer at her as I move past, right out of the tunnel and into an expansive room, large enough that parts of it fade into darkness. It’s oddly very similar to the whale room we were in hours ago, the same one where we all joined up to begin with.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The others pile into the room behind me. Angaza’s marble eyes shine in the darkness. “Is this what I’m thinking it is?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The same realization that’s surely going through Angaza’s head jolts through mine as well. It isn’t oddly similar to the whale room. It is the whale room.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn’s head tilts, eyes narrowing. “We’ve gone in one giant circle. Ren’s strategy failed.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Chapter 3\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren scratches his chin. “It should work… unless the cave has a loop that doesn’t connect to a way out. That must be it.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We shouldn’t have listened to you,” Dawn says, crossing her arms.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren lifts both palms up. “I was only trying to help. Besides, it’s not like you suggested a plan.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I clearly should have,” Dawn says, her voice as cold as the surrounding rocks.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I don’t know Dawn any better than the backend coding of a crodus drone, but I have a feeling that if she’d had an idea before, she would have already tried to convince everyone it was a better plan than Ren’s.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Let’s maybe calm down a little,” Angaza says, though he steps away from them all the same.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn scowls, but she backs off. “You’re right. I’m sorry, Ren,” she finally says, her voice flat. “We need a new plan.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We need a lot more than that,” I mumble.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Excuse me?” Dawn says, her lips curling.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We need navitech. We need commdevs. Even water would be nice.” I throw my hands in the air. “And maybe you don’t feel like it’s something we need, but I need answers!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza clears his throat. “I may not be able to help you with all of those things, but there’s water over there.” He points to a side of the room that’s enshrouded with darkness.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren steps forward. “Angaza, you’re telling us that we passed through here before and you didn’t mention there was water?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza looks at the ground and gives a half shrug. “I didn’t realize we’d be stuck in here so long. And I wasn’t thirsty.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren takes a deep breath. “Well, thank you for telling us now. Let’s go fill up our canteens.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn heads toward the darkness with a clenched jaw, and Angaza follows with his head down.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren waits, his gaze fixed on me. “Coming, Ginny? You were the one who brought up water to begin with.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My lips tighten. “In a dark corner after I’ve seen some sort of phantom around here? I’m letting them be the guinea pigs.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We’ll be fine. I promise,” Ren says. “There’s nobody else in here. If you knew more, you’d understand why.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My back stiffens. “Oh? And you really think I shouldn’t know what’s going on?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren shrugs and kicks a rock into the shadows. It clatters unseen in the darkness. “Honestly? I don’t know if you should or shouldn’t.” He glances in Dawn’s direction before leaning in and whispering, “Believe it or not, I want to tell you everything. But there’s a chance that, yes, you shouldn’t know. And once we tell you, there’s no taking it back.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The tension simmers out of my jaw and shoulders. He really is conflicted. This is the slit in the husk, the point where I can start peeling back skin until I get to the fruit inside. He isn’t ready to tell me anything yet, but he will be—if I can get him to warm up to me. \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I guess that’s an okay answer—for now.” I motion toward the far end of the room. “It looks like the shadowman didn’t attack them. Shall we?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren nods and walks toward the dark side. I follow, careful where I place each step. Despite how tame the ground is—so weird for a cave—my feet still find uneven spots, especially around the spots where the dark green stalagmites poke up.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn and Angaza kneel near two large stalagmites. As I direct my lumitech in their direction, the light reflects off tiny ripples in water—a small, slow-moving stream. What’s more, the air is fresher here than it is in the tunnels, like there’s more airflow.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "There’s not enough space for anyone else at the stream—the water must come out of a hole in the rock and then go right back in—so Ren and I wait our turn.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza looks in our direction, his marble eyes flashing in my beam. “Sorry for the delay.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“It’s all good,” Ren says. “Take your time.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“So what’s up with Angaza’s eyes?” I say to Ren, keeping my voice down. “Have they always been like that?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren’s gaze drops to hands, which he suddenly finds intriguing. “Oh, his eyes? You mean, like how they shine and stuff? Uh… no.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“They seriously creep me out,” I say. “Does he have some sort of tech contacts? I didn’t know they made any that shine like that.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Not contacts. They’ve just been like that since we came in here,” Ren says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The breath gets caught in my throat. “What happened to them?” I squeak.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren raises his head and finally meets my eyes. “The purge.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My tongue rubs the roof of my mouth, dry and rough. “What’s that?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren drops to his knees and starts rummaging through his pack, stirring up dust that floats through the air. “We should get our canteens out.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I kneel next to Ren. “What’s the purge?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren searches through his backpack, each movement slow and precise. “Something that happened to us when we came in here. Something we agreed to.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I lean closer, the dust tickling my nostrils. “What happened?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren slinks away, sitting on his heels. “Ginny… I can’t say. I’m sorry about all of this—about everything. I didn’t expect you not to remember anything. This is all—well, it’s hard.” He retrieves his canteen and seals his pack back up with a ziiiiiip that disturbs the cave’s silence.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I snort and turn away. He thinks it’s hard. It’s way harder for me.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We both stand, but I keep my focus on the rock wall to my side. And here I thought he might actually tell me something useful.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren shifts his weight back and forth from one leg to another. “You know, you revealed hardly anything about yourself when we first met. The tables have turned, and there’s some sweet poetic justice to that.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I peer at him, complete with his stupid smile and the perfect bruise around his eye socket. “Are you asking to be punched in the face again?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A big, hearty laugh escapes his mouth before it dies on his lips. “Wait—you are joking, right?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I only shrug and smile. I’m not sure if it was a joke myself.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "When it’s our turn, I kneel by the stream and open my canteen’s lid. Ah, so there’s a top-grade microfilter lodged inside, is there? I’ve heard somewhere that cave water is purified through the earth, but the filter is a nice backup. Besides, who knows how reliable my memories are? I can’t remember whether it was a geologist or a janitor who told me.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I plunge my canteen into the stream, immersing my hands in the chilly water and allowing it to flow inside. I drink through the filter allowing it to soak my tongue before I swish it around and swallow. After guzzling down the full canteen, I dip it back into the water and repeat. Once finished, I cap the canteen and flick the water away, allowing the last drops to trickle from my fingertips.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Clipping the canteen to the side of my pack, I glance around. Ren is already standing but waiting for me before he joins the others. As the two of us approach Dawn and Angaza, a thought about the rest of our group crosses my mind. Who are they? As varied as the four of us? Boys or girls?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn and Angaza turn so we all form a circle. A circle? Really? What a brilliant idea to have everyone’s backs facing outward! I keep alert, scanning three hundred and sixty degrees. Someone’s got to keep an eye out for the shadowman.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Something wrong, Ginny?” Dawn asks. “Or do you want to join us?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I shift my attention to her, matching the intensity in her gaze. “Oh, acting like I’m part of the group now?” My eyes dart around the room again. “I’m just keeping a lookout. I saw the shadowman around here, remember? Can you blame me?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn rolls her eyes. “How sure are you that you actually saw something back there?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My teeth clench together. “One hundred percent.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn’s face tightens. “How many times do we have to tell you? There’s nobody else in here except the rest of our group. You keep begging for answers. How about believing the ones we give you?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Excuse me?” I say.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn folds her arms. “The truth doesn’t change just because you’re not convinced of it.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren extends his hand. “Let’s just figure out a new plan.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“That’s nice, coming from you,” Dawn says. “Weren’t you the one who suggested the last failed plan?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren’s hands run through his black hair. “Sorry, okay? Let’s move on.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza shrugs. “This room has several tunnels. Maybe we just pick one and go?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn closes her eyes and breathes deeply. “Okay, yes. Let’s just do that. Move on. Which way?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Before any of us can suggest a direction, a distant scream echoes through the cave, piercing through the closest tunnel.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Without another word, Dawn charges into the nearest tunnel where the scream came from. Ren follows, and I run next before Angaza can. I’m not all that excited to rush toward apparent danger, but there is no way I’m allowing them to leave me here alone.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We plunge through the darkness, our lumitech beams traversing across the tunnel walls as they speed past. I stumble a few times but catch myself before I can truly fall. Thank goodness the path is so smooth or there’d be no way we could travel this fast.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The screams continue off and on for about a minute before going silent.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Gregory!” Dawn calls, slowing down. “Where are you?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "When we get no response, Dawn stops completely, halting the rest of us. “Gregory?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza cups his hands. “Ilma? Nando?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Still no response. “Was that them?” I ask. “The ones we’re looking for?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The others share uncertain glances. “Maybe?” Dawn says. “It’s hard to tell from a few distant screams.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Nobody asks the most obvious question: why were they screaming?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Dawn!” The word echoes faintly through the tunnels, but it is distinct and unmistakable.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn’s uncertain expression switches to one of confidence coupled with a smile. “That’s Gregory, all right. This way.” She begins running through the corridors again—not quite at the breakneck pace as before, but still faster than is reasonable in a cave.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren follows without much delay. Before Angaza can pass me, I charge ahead. I refuse to be exposed in front or behind. Perhaps we’re running toward danger, but I’d prefer not to be left alone, and if I’m coming along, I want someone else between me and any threat.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "At first, we get only sporadic responses to our calls to the others, occurring only every few minutes. But the longer we travel through the cave, the more frequent they become, until they’re calling out to us every ten seconds or so. And thankfully, the calls also become louder, until we see light around a bend in the tunnel.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Three other teenagers appear on the far side, all wearing similar techsuits as us and carrying packs like ours. Even from this distance and with the limited light, the relief is evident on their faces. They rush toward us.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A black-haired boy with tan skin leads, followed by a girl with flowing blonde hair and a pale redhead boy with freckles.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Good morning!” the leader says. He scans the walls cloaked in shadows, and he shrugs. “Maybe.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn holds out a hand, palm facing the newcomers. “Before you say anything else, I need to warn you that Ginny’s memory is gone.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Really?” the blonde says. “What happened?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn chews her lip, but I cut in before she can say anything. “Let me help you,” I say to Dawn, laying on the fake sincerity enough that there’s no way she can miss my sarcasm. Then I turn to the others. “Something about forgones.” All three of their expressions register confusion. “And something about the first pact.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Wait,” the blonde says. “How much do you know?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Why don’t you start talking,” I say, “and I’ll stop you when we get to the part I don’t know yet.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Not anything else,” Dawn butts in. “I trust you all understand why.” The three of them nod without another word.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Great. More closed mouths on the topic of what’s going on.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren turns to me, apparently eager to add something before I can toss in a retort. “That’s Nando,” he says, pointing to the boy in front. “and Ilma”—the blonde—“and Gregory”—the redhead.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We all stare at each other for an awkward moment. What are we supposed to do? Wave?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I’m Ginny. And you already know that.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Nando and Ilma both respond with polite smiles. Gregory only raises an eyebrow.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma steps forward, focused now on Dawn and Ren. “Have you seen that thing with the cloak?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Few things in life are as gratifying as being proven right, though I’d prefer the shadowman weren’t real.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren and Dawn exchange startled looks. “Ginny has,” Ren says before casting me an uneasy smile. He mouths “sorry” to me. Dawn doesn’t even make eye contact.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We saw it from a distance early on,” Gregory says, “but as it didn’t see us, we kept quiet. When we heard you yelling about to find each other, we thought about shouting a cooee of our own to let you know where we were, but we decided not to so we wouldn’t attract that thing’s attention.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Nando nods vigorously. “Yes, and then it was rude enough to see us anyway.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Thus your screams,” Dawn says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Right,” Ilma says. “But we must have scared it off because when we ran, it didn’t follow us. So we decided perhaps it was safe to call out after all. And here we all are.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Here we all are,” Dawn repeats.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“When I saw the shadowman,” I say, “it reached for me. And it called me by name. What is it?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Unfortunately, we don’t know any more than you,” Ilma says. When I frown in skepticism, she adds, “and that’s the truth.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I shift my attention to Dawn. “Since you actually believe me now, maybe I can have my triggers?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“You took her triggers?” Ilma asks.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn sighs. “We didn’t take them. We started out with her pack.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "That’s new. “Started out?” I say. “Started what?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren raises his hands, motioning in my direction. “Maybe we should give her the triggers. We don’t know what this shadowman is or what it might do.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "It’s a blatant misdirection from my question, but as Dawn reaches in her pack for my triggers—and as they’ve just been brushing off my questions since the beginning—I let it slide. But I will get my answers. The revelation that the shadowman is real has changed Ren at the very least.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn hands me the triggers, and I eagerly take them. “Attach them on your collarbone on either side of your neck,” she says, pointing at the spots with both hands.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I tug on my techsuit. How are these supposed to attach?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Here,” Ilma says, “let me help you.” I shuffle to the back with Ilma and hold still while she activates some sort of mechanism that holds the trigger patches in place.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“To use them, you have to press both at the same time for three full seconds,” Dawn explains. “Don’t ever press them unless you absolutely have to, basically if you’re going to die. The entire setup—the positioning on your collarbone, the fact that there are two of them, the three-second time requirement—it’s all designed to prevent accidental activation.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“What in the world do they do?” I turn back around to face Dawn. We’ve all traded positions now, with Gregory by Dawn and Nando up ahead, peering in the direction we came. Anagaza’s marble eyes are glancing about while Ren’s gaze is focused on me.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn shakes her head. “Just don’t press them.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma finishes attaching the triggers before moving on to say something to Angaza. My fingers trace the triggers’ outline. Static buzzes, humming a symphony of faint crackles all around us and through the tunnel.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I said don’t press them,” Dawn snaps.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I hold my hands up, palms out. “I didn’t.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Static rips through the air, exploding behind me, and goosebumps assault my skin. I turn back around. Two dozen feet away, the shadowman rounds the bend.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Chapter 4\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My jaw drops. After all this effort to keep someone between myself and the darkness, the second I’m exposed, the shadowman shows up.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "It stands upright, its arms outstretched.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Gregory gasps. “Crikey! Not again!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A shriek erupts from the shadowman, accompanied by another wave of static that ends in a pop that echoes through the cave. The shadowman charges us, and I scream.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren seizes my hand. “New plan: run!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We turn around and rush forward, our feet striking the ground with a rapid thud, thud, thud, thud, thud. Everyone’s lights bounce across the tunnel walls in a frantic dance. What light we have is barely enough to keep us all on two feet at this speed, but by some miracle, we manage it.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "As we round a corner, I spare a glance back. Only a dozen feet behind us! How’d it catch up that fast? We’ll never outrun it—and I’m the first one it’ll catch.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Aiiee!” I unclip my canteen and hurl it at the shadowman. I don’t watch long enough to see if I score a hit. Thump. The corners of my mouth tug upward. Got it!\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "At the front, Dawn points ahead. “A fork! Split up! Maybe we can lose it!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Me, I’ll split!” Angaza shouts.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We sprint through the tunnel. At the fork, Nando, Gregory, and Dawn dash left. Angaza turns right, and the rest of us follow.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We barrel through the darkness at full speed, zipping around corners without any regard for what we might run into. If the path stops, we might discover a new meaning for “dead end.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Wait!” Ilma hisses.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We crash to a halt, bumping into one another as we stumble. Ren topples altogether and hits the ground.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The passageway we just ran through is empty. Nothing’s behind us.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My chest heaves; my lungs gasp for air. The others respond the same—except for Ilma, who doesn’t huff in the slightest despite looking lightheaded enough to faint.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My head drops to my hands, and I fight back tears, all while careful to keep one eye on the darkness behind us. My lip quivers. That was close. That was way too close.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren places his hand on my shoulder. My first instinct is to recoil, to snap that he shouldn’t touch me, but there’s something comforting about a human connection after we just faced something so inhuman.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Wow, that was—that was pretty terrifying,” he says. “I’m sorry we didn’t believe you before.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I lost my canteen,” is all I say.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma wipes sweat off her rosy face. She hasn’t recovered as quickly as the rest of us. “Sorry to hear that. Hopefully the others are okay and they haven’t lost more than a canteen. It looks like it followed them and not us.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren removes his hand, leaving a bloody imprint on my sleeve. I gasp. “Are you okay?” \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Yeah.” He follows my gaze to my shoulder before glancing down at his hand. Blood drips to the ground in a tiny crimson reservoir. His eyes widen, but he quickly hides any shock behind a smile. “Oh, that? It’s fine. Totally fine.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“You’re bleeding!” I say with a level of concern that surprises me. Didn’t I just meet this guy? Or are some of my memories re-emerging subconsciously?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Congratulations on being the first casualty, Ren,” Ilma says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "An uneasy laugh escapes Ren’s mouth. “It’s fine, really. Doesn’t hurt.” I find that hard to believe with the blood oozing from his hand, but Ren’s poker face remains calm and relaxed.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma tightens her lips. “Let’s get some pressure on that. Did anyone get a bandage in their packs?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Doesn’t everybody have the same things?” Angaza says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Oh, tosh.” Ilma straightens her arm, twists her forearm, bends her elbow, and twists her forearm back the other direction, all while holding her bicep with her other hand. In the process, a blade juts out of her forearm—another trick of the techsuit, if you only know how to activate it. And now I do.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I need your hammock,” she says to Ren.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Why?” Ren asks.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“So I can cut a strip of cloth off as a bandage,” Ilma says. “We could use some water, too.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren groans. “Do you really need to cut up my hammock?” He holds his hand out, keeping the drops of blood away from his clothing.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma shifts her gaze from Ren’s hand to his face. “Even if it doesn’t hurt, it could still get infected. We really shouldn’t take any chances, especially this early in the—” she casts a glance back at me “—erm, well, you know.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“This early in what?” I challenge. “The assessment?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma’s eyes narrow and return to Ren. “Wait—how much does she know?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren slides his pack off his shoulders, careful to avoid moving his wounded hand as much as possible. “I mentioned it before we knew her memory was wiped.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I lean forward. “Wiped?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma giggles. “You better just give me your hammock and keep your mouth closed before you let something else slip.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren grumbles while he rummages through his pack with his good hand.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I step between them, my jaw clenched. “You can’t let it go that easily. Somebody erased my memory?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma places her hand on my shoulder and nudges me, but I don’t budge. “Please, Ginny,” she says. “Ren’s hand.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I move to the side, clenching my fists.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren passes his hammock—large and coarse, colored with soft, earthy tones—to Ilma. “Think about how Ginny feels,” he says. “We need to give her something to go on. It’s not fair.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Think about how she feels?” Ilma responds. “What about how she felt? What about how she will feel?” She casts me an embarrassed glance. “I mean no offense, Ginny. But we can’t explain anything. You just have to trust us for now.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "When someone tells you that you “just have to trust them,” it means they’re as trustworthy as a weather forecast without any atmosphere tech.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "But I leave the issue alone. I think Ren will give in, but I can’t get too pushy.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma jabs the hammock with the blade and cuts a long, narrow strip. The cream-colored fabric doesn’t give way easily, though it finally surrenders with a tearing sound. Angaza passes his canteen to Ilma. Ren stands, and she cleans the blood from his hand before wrapping it.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Good thing your hand isn’t broken,” Ilma says as she completes the makeshift bandage. “That could really mess you up at this point.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren opens and closes his other fist, pumping an invisible stress ball. “So you’re sure it isn’t broken?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma releases a light laugh. “If it was, you’d have screamed or something as I wrapped your hand.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren squirms. “Suppose I had been knocked out and couldn’t have screamed. Would you think it was broken then?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma stops laughing and pulls her blonde hair out of her eyes to peer at Ren better. “Oh.” She glances back at his hand. “Hmm. No, I don’t think it’s broken. I’m not a med or anything, but it seemed okay aside from the blood. And even that wasn’t as bad as it looked.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren flashes a weak smile and withdraws his mummified hand, holding it close to his body. “We need to keep moving,” he says. “And we need to figure out how to reconnect with everyone.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I shine my light into the tunnel behind us. Dust hangs in the air, somehow filling up an empty space and making it even more desolate. “I’m not going at the end.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“That’s fine, considering,” Ilma says. “I’ll go up front, then you. Ren’s next since he’s injured. Then Angaza in the rear.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza’s eyes twitch. “Me? Back there?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Of course,” Ilma says, “just like the gentleman you are. Cheers!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I’m not that much of a gentleman,” Angaza mutters, but he shuffles to the back.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "None of us shout for the others, not when the shadowman is out there lurking in the darkness. And we don’t dare backtrack. We must simply hope that we’ll meet up with them somehow. Either that, or time will eventually ease the others’ fears of the shadowman—not mine though.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I wipe a bead of sweat from my forehead with a still-shaking hand. The air is cool, but I’m still not over the adrenaline rush. I rotate my shoulders to loosen them—it doesn’t work, but it reminds me of the patches on my collarbone.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“These triggers—what do they do? The shadowman kinda interrupted us before you could tell me.” Technically I’m not sure Ren was going to tell me before, but now that Dawn isn’t with us, maybe he will.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma glances back and nods. “Ginny should know what they do—what they actually do.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren sighs. “If you activate the triggers, E.L.—the organization that sent us in here—they’ll take you back out immediately. And I mean immediately.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I stop and turn around to face Ren. “Isn’t that what we want?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“No.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“So they’re evil? Or something? They’ll do something to us?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren scratches his head. “Well, no.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“So we do want to be in here?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren shakes his head. “Again, no.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Can we keep moving?” Angaza says between glances over his shoulder.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I face forward and move behind Ilma again. “I don’t understand. We’re trying to get out of this cave, but we don’t want to use an easy method we already have?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“See, that’s why we don’t want to explain stuff to you,” Ren grumbles.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma sneaks a look back at me. “It’s because they’ll take us out, but they still won’t take us where we’re trying to go.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I’m not trying to go anywhere,” I say. “I’m just trying to get out. So pushing the buttons seems like exactly what I want.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“But you won’t know what you’re giving up,” Ren says. “You know we’re in an assessment. Pushing those buttons means you fail the assessment. The only time you should put those is when the alternative is certain death.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“What about likely death?” I ask. “Because the shadowman almost got me back there.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Certain death,” Ren repeats, and there’s a finality to his tone that tells me that I won’t be getting any more answers for the moment. I think I can settle for that, but how long until we run into the shadowman again?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We sneak through the passages for at least half an hour. Tiny particles float wherever I shine my lumitech, and the air tastes of dust. The repetitive grainy texture of the rock walls makes every tunnel look like the last.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A rock clatters ahead, around a turn. Knees trembling, I stop, holding out a hand behind to keep the Ren from bumping into me. Ahead, Ilma halts as well. Dust hangs in the dry air. It sticks to my tongue, and I close my mouth to stop it from infiltrating my tastebuds.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Keep going. There was a noise back here,” Angaza whispers, an edge to his voice.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“No,” I reply, “it was up ahead.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "His marble eyes widen. A rock rattles again—is it behind after all?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I inhale sharply and paste myself against the wall, pressing my arms into its jagged stone. It’s cool to the touch and sends shivers down my spine and through my limbs.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Neither of us is wrong. We’re surrounded.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Chapter 5\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Our lights rake the tunnels in front and behind us, but they catch no movement, and no more rocks disturb the silence.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A buzz hums from ahead. The shadowman? No… not a buzz, a murmur.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Voices,” Ilma whispers.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My fingers clutch grainy bulges in the rocky wall. “Shadowmen.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren silently drums the fingers of his good hand against his leg. “It’s the others—Dawn and Nando and Gregory.” He stops drumming and motions us to proceed. “Come on.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We creep through tunnel after tunnel, but the closer we get, the more obvious it is that Ren’s right. We stumble back into a large room where the other three are huddled in conversation. Their lights snap in our direction.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Oh good,” Nando says with a sigh. “You’re just the people we were hoping to run into—though we’re just standing here, not really running.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I scan my flashlight around the chamber—same expansive space, same familiar walls, same stream. The whale room.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren’s shoulders slump. “Here again?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“It’s like the hub.” Angaza’s light travels across the stalactites.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Hmm,” Dawn says. “Let’s break for camp. I think we’re all plenty tired. And since this is the only place with water, it might be a good place to stop. Besides, the air doesn’t feel as stagnant in here.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Everyone drops their packs to the ground, but I grip my pack by the shoulder straps, squeezing the fabric into my palms. “What about the shadowman?” I say. “It could be out there.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn groans. “You’d rather rest in one of those confined tunnels? Then we’d really be screwed if your shadowman shows up again.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I point through the entry we came through. “We might’ve heard something back there.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We did hear something back there,” Angaza says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn turns her light toward Angaza, and his eyes reflect it like a pair of tiny moons. “But did you see anything?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza frowns. “Well… no.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I still think it’s best to stay here,” Dawn says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren frowns and rolls his eyes, but he says nothing.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn approaches, a single eyebrow crawling up her forehead. “First the eye, then your hand? You okay?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren doesn’t make eye contact, instead pointing to the stream. “Fine. Just about ready to find a place to rest is all.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn twists around, her eyes unfocused as her fingers trace a line down her face. Then with a blink, the gaze of scrutiny is back. “Find a place to sleep, Ginny.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Sure, sure. Let’s die here. Then again, maybe she’s right. Even if we’re still in danger, is anywhere else safer?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma, Nando and Gregory wander about, kneeling and rubbing the ground back and forth. With everybody else staking out their own parcel of stony land, I shine my light around, looking for the most even spot I can find with at least one other person between it and the entryways. Do I feel like a part of this group? Not truly, but there’s strength in numbers. \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "While everybody settles in, I sneak over to the stream for a drink. We’re lucky there’s water in this cave—and that we keep finding our way back to it.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I crouch and reach into the cool water, cupping my hand and raising it to my lips. I savor each sip, refreshing my parched throat. We did a lot of running.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren kneels next to me and extends his canteen. “Here, use mine.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I’m fine, really.” I raise my cupped hand.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren pulls his hand back and shrugs. “Whatever you want. But when we’re back in the tunnels and you want a drink, you know who to ask. We’ll all get through this together.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I nod with a half-smile, and he leaves me in peace. Hopefully, I don’t get to the point where I start owing people favors like that. But still… the gesture is nice.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "When I return to my pack, I rifle through it and pluck out a package I hope is food. I place my left hand on my right bicep and complete the same motions I saw Ilma perform before. Sure enough, my sleeve’s fabric adjusts position to reveal tiny edges which interconnect to form a small blade. I slice the bag open and peer inside. Dried potato, cubed. Firm but pliable, each cube breaks apart with every bite, releasing a lightly salted starch. I’ve tasted better, but it’ll do. After walking all day, I’d expect to be famished, but I’m not. Good thing, too, as I’m not sure how long these rations are supposed to last.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "There isn’t a place to string up my hammock, so I arrange it on the floor as a ground cloth instead and place my pack at its head. Will it work as a pillow? Maybe, maybe not, but at least nobody will try to take it this way.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I lie on my back, my bare arms resting along the coarse fabric. Not the most comfortable bed, but it’s better than nothing. Despite how exhausted I am, both physically and emotionally, there’s no way I’m going to sleep a wink—not when there’s the shadowman out there. Even so, I turn off my lights and close my eyes, allowing my thoughts to drift as I try to jostle any more memories that might be ready to resurface.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny, wake up,” Ren whispers, his breath tickling my cheek. I jolt up, disoriented. The bustle of preparing beds has been silenced, replaced only by light snoring. Did I doze off?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren’s lumitech is the only illumination, a dim nightlight. The faint trickling of the stream matches the ambience well.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“What’s going on?” I say, my fingers tickling my sleeves to activate my lumitech. Once it’s on, I sweep both beams across every corner, highlighting the contours of the stalagmites. Everything is very still.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“It’s your turn,” Ren says, “for the watch.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I respond with a blank stare and a few rapid blinks. “Watch?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "He reclines, throwing his arms behind for support. “You know, in case that thing comes back, someone will be awake at all times, taking turns. Wake up Angaza when you’re done. He’s next.” He turns off his lumitech and lies down with his bag, only a few feet away from me. Who gave him permission to sleep that close?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I wring my hands. “How long is each watch?” My techsuit is equipped with a basic timer, so it won’t be a problem to measure time, even without a clock to give the current hour.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren rolls to the side, turning his back to me. “We talked about that. It’s whatever you feel like you can handle, up to two hours, though I personally wouldn’t stay up that long. Just don’t make it too short. I forget whose turn is after Angaza’s, but he’ll remember.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I give my head a good shake and force my eyes wider. But by the time I’m a little more coherent, Ren’s snoring. Looks like I’m on my own—though in a way, I’ve been on my own this whole time. I glance around and shudder. How did I end up in this nightmare? Why did this happen to me?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My light scans the scene, surveying both entryways over and over. I count the others, reminding myself of their names: Gregory, the redhead; Dawn, the bossy one; Nando, the funny one; Ilma, the blonde; Angaza, the one with glowing eyes; and Ren, the one who’ll eventually tell me what’s going on. I’ve seen it written across his troubled face every time he looks at me. He’ll break.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The group talks and acts like I’m one of them, but am I really? It’s obvious they know each other well. But only Ren really talks to me. Even with my memory loss, that’s weird. The remnants of my memories are so vague, but shouldn’t these guys at least feel normal to me? We look different. We act different. If we’d always been friends, shouldn’t I feel comfortable around them regardless of what I remember? I might be with them, but I’m still alone.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "It’s amazing how much you can hear in dead silence. As the minutes limp by, the faintest sounds seem amplified, like the trickling of the stream or someone rolling over in their sleep. The silence is punctuated with constant shallow breaths. But no footsteps. In the darkness, the shadowman’s invisible. Is it mute too? What does that static sound mean? Is it carrying tech we don’t have?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I’ve seen the shadowman twice. This better not be like baseball or we could be in a strikeout situation any time.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Kuk kukuk.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A rock—maybe only a pebble?—clatters across the floor on the other side of the chamber.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Blood stampedes through my veins. A bead of sweat slides down the back of my neck. My breath catches, impossible to sneak out of my throat.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Not another sound disturbs the lullaby of the trickling stream. Nothing.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A whisper creeps through the shadows, calling me by name: “Ginny.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My arm spasms, showering the walls with light, but nothing’s there. My head jerks back and forth, sending my black hair into a dance. What terrible thing is out there in the cave’s darkness, hissing my name? Has the shadow man returned?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny. Ginny.” The whisper slinks into my ear again, but this time, it’s clearer where it’s coming from: someone in the group, not a faceless mystery in the blackness.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Yeah,” I whisper back, barely audible even to my ears.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A figure nearby rises. My heart jolts again, and a fully formed scream catches wordlessly in my throat before it can escape. Dawn. It’s just Dawn, this whole time. I clutch my forehead and try to steady my breathing.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Did you hear that rock?” she whispers.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Yes,” I say.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“What was it?” she asks, glancing into the darkness and back at me.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I shrug. “Like I know.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I slowly force my fist open, trying to prevent Dawn from seeing how tightly I had it clenched.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Hmm.” Dawn turns on her own lumitech and gets up, coasting around the room, inspecting the far end. She isn’t my favorite person, but I’m glad she’s awake. I didn’t want to check that sound myself.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The light flashes around the walls and floor on the other side, steady and methodical. After a thorough sweep, Dawn returns. “Nothing there. Probably only a loose rock falling or something, but I’ll stay up with you for a minute just in case.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Okay,” I say. I really mean thanks, but I don’t want Dawn to feel like she’s doing me a favor. I don’t want to owe anyone.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We sit in silence, the stillness of the air creating tension in the wake of that single pebble rattle. We’re back to the occasional moan from one of the others and the solo played by the ever-trickling stream. It seems so present now; I’m surprised we hadn’t noticed it before Angaza mentioned it.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny, I know we’re not like BFFs or anything, but can I ask you a question?” Dawn says, her voice still low.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Where is she going with a beginning like that? I cross my arms and peer at her, my lips pressed shut. At last, I say, “Sure.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Is your memory really gone? Completely?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I exhale, long and drawn out. “Uh, yeah. I mean, not completely, but mostly. I can remember feelings of memories, but nothing solid. And nothing recent. I don’t remember any of you guys. Why do you all insist on not telling me anything?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Now it’s Dawn’s turn to take in a deep breath, but when she finishes, she only bites her lip and watches me in the darkness. “It’s because… you wouldn’t want us to tell you.” She smiles, but it isn’t cold or unfriendly—it’s genuine and warm. It seems out of place in the cool dampness of the cave, but they both leave me in the same spot—completely in the dark.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Do you even realize what you’re saying?” I wring my hands through my hair, struggling to keep my voice down. “Of course I want you to tell me. Look, I know my memory was wiped. There is something evil and sinister behind that, and you acting like I don’t want to know is only making it look like you’re somehow part of it all. How am I supposed to trust you in a situation like this? The only one who gives me any hope you are actually my friends is Ren, and even he has barely told me anything.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn’s gaze drops to the floor, and for a moment, she’s completely still. But there’s gotta be something going on inside that skull. Her eyes are too focused, and her jaw remains set. I prepare myself with a dozen counter arguments to whatever she might say.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I don’t have anything against you. I really don’t,” she says, finally raising her head and making eye contact. “I like you. But if there is one thing that you need to understand about where we are and why we’re here, it’s this…” Her speech slows into an outright pause, and she looks away again, out into the darkness, as her finger traces an invisible line down her face. “Ginny, if you don’t have your memory in here, it’s because you wanted it wiped.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Chapter 6\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn’s statement hits me like a sack of potting soil directly in the gut, and it leaves me speechless, gasping for comprehension.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I cast my gaze around the whale room, a hollow nothingness that’s as empty and dark as my memory. Her words echo in my mind: you wanted it wiped.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“If we tell you anything about what you’ve forgotten,” Dawn says, “we’d be going against your own wishes. You think we must not be your friends because we don’t tell you anything, but actually, we’re zipped up about it because we’re your friends.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I clench my eyes shut and shake my head in massive sweeping motions. “No, this can’t be true. Why—why would I want to lose my memory?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Honestly? No idea,” Dawn says. “But regardless of what it seems like, you’ve gotta understand that I am your friend—and I always will be, no matter what. Don’t forget this.” She snaps each of these final words, emphasizing every syllable.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I bury my head in my hands, allowing my fingers to massage my scalp and run through my long hair. My back stiffens, and a single tear sneaks down my cheek. Did Dawn tell me the truth? Did I really want to lose my memory? What was so horrible that I wanted to forget everything?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“So,” I croak, raising my head again, “what’s the plan now?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn’s eyebrows tighten, and she purses her lips. “I’m not sure. If we had a canvatab—or even simple pen and paper—we could start mapping the area. We might have to mark something with a blade. Or maybe we try to memorize where we go. It just doesn’t make sense...”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I nod. If there was a way in, there must be a way out, but Dawn seems to have certain expectations about this place—expectations which are not being met.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny,” Dawn says, “did you notice anything unusual happen?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I grunt. “You mean besides wandering around a pitch-black cave with a group of strangers?” It’s obvious, but she totally asked for it.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“What about Ren’s hand?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I cock my head. That was a little unusual. Why was Ren concerned if his hand was broken when it clearly wasn’t?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I explain the situation. Dawn nods along with the rhythm of my speech, saying only “Interesting…” when I finish.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Why do you ask?” I say.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn only shrugs. “Trying to piece things together, that’s all. We’re all a little in the dark here.” She holds her hands out in the dim light. “Obviously.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We sit for a few more minutes, but it’s soon clear that whatever caused the pebble noise earlier—natural or otherwise—isn’t going to give us a repeat performance.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn wipes her hand across her hammock to brush a little dirt off, and she straightens her pack-turned-pillow. “I think I’m going back to sleep. Should we wake Angaza so he can start his watch?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Sure,” I say. My watch was long enough, right? Did I already mention to Dawn how long I’d been awake before she got up?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I place my hands on the cool rocky ground to help lift me up, but Dawn extends her arm, motioning me to stay down. “Don’t worry; I’ll wake him up.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "She jumps up and approaches Angaza, meandering through the sleeping bodies to avoid waking anyone else in the process. She kneels and gently shakes the boy lying on the ground.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Within seconds, those familiar marble eyes shine in the darkness, reflecting the dim light. “You’re both awake?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We heard something,” I say, pointing across the room. “A rock. Probably nothing though—haven’t heard anything since.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza springs up, those marble eyes wide as moons. “You heard something?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Yeah.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "He leans forward as his muscles tighten. “And now you’re going back to sleep?” He flips on his lumitech and waves it across the room, illuminating the rocky walls and periodic stalactites.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn lies back down next to her pack. “I’m a light sleeper. If anything happens, I’ll wake up. Don’t worry; you won’t be alone.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The beam bounces around, the flashlight trembling. Angaza creeps about the room, scanning each cranny. “Don’t you dare go back to sleep until I’ve made sure nothing’s here.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn covers her face, massaging around her eyes. “Take your time.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza’s light continues to sweep the room like a digibrush coloring a canvatab in broad strokes, but his gaze jumps back and forth, not always in the same direction as his lumitech. His silhouette stills, and his light beam creeps to the ceiling. “Dawn, get over here! I’m thinking I found the way out!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn leaps to her feet and rushes over. Angaza points at the ceiling as they talk, their words reaching me in mumbles. Is it really the way out? I push myself up and jog toward them.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza peers at me with his shining eyes. “Look,” he says. Above us lies a three-feet-wide hole connected to another chamber above us. And since the ceiling is nearly within arm’s reach, we can totally get up there with a small boost. This is it—this is what we’ve been missing!\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We’ve been approaching this all wrong,” Dawn says, her neck craned. “We thought it was a maze, so we were thinking about it in two dimensions. But a real cave is three dimensions.” She drops her gaze to Angaza and me. “Way to go, Angaza! This is the breakthrough we’ve been waiting for! Wake everyone up. It’s time to go.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Adrenaline pumps through my limbs as we race back to the others. I kneel and place my hand on Ren’s right shoulder before shaking firmly. “Get up! We found the way out!”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "His eyelids slit open before widening in a burst. “What? Are you serious?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Yeah,” I say. “Well, we technically don’t know if it’s the way out, but it looks promising.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Without another word, he sits up and throws everything into his bag.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Within minutes, everyone is packed up and on their feet, staring into the opening in the ceiling. With the light shining on it, it’s clear there’s a gap leading somewhere, but it disappears into the shadows without the light. No wonder we missed it before.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Gregory stretches his hand high, though the hole’s rocky edges remain out of reach. “Good on ya, Angaza! How’d you see this?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza shrugs. “I just did. That’s all.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Well,” Dawn says, tilting her head to watch Angaza, “being able to see in the dark helps too.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Angaza ducks his head away from Dawn. “That too, yes.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Nice,” Ren says, his voice oozing with sarcasm. “Not like we’re keeping our forgones on the down-low or anything.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ay, come on. We all knew it,” Nando says. He pushes his pointer finger into Ren’s chest. “Besides, not all forgones are secret now, you know?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "There’s that word again—forgone. It echoes from the depths of my memory. “What is a forgone?” I ask again.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren crosses his arms and backs away from Nando. “You guys, we gotta tell her. We’re dragging her along, and she has no idea what’s going on.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn shakes her head. “You know we can’t. For her sake, we can’t.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“So it’s true I chose my memory wipe?” I blurt out.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn taps her fingers at her side and looks at Ren expectantly. His shoulders slump as he exhales.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma steps toward me and stares into my eyes as though trying to reach some distant memory. She takes my hand with a light squeeze. “It’s most likely. The only reason we’re holding anything back is because you didn’t want to remember them.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "So… Dawn wasn’t lying about that. I really did want my memory wiped.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A tiny piece of my soul has just been crushed.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren doesn’t nod, only crosses his arms. “We should at least tell her something. How would you feel in her situation?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I’m sorry, but you’re outvoted, Ren,” Dawn says, her back stiff.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Gregory, his red hair as fiery as his expression, glares as Ren. “Besides, it’s not like Ginny’s really even one of us, mate.” A chill plunges down my spine. Who am I, then?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren’s hands clench at his sides. “Yes, she is.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn turns to Gregory and gives her head the tiniest of shakes. “Don’t do this. She wouldn’t be here if she weren’t part of us.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Gregory steps backward, and his shoulders slump. “Okay, okay. Sorry.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We stand in silence, eyes darting everywhere except into anyone else’s eyes. What am I, an injured puppy that everyone feels sorry for but no one wants to help?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren steps forward and drops to all fours. “Well, let’s get up there. Who’s first? Step on up.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“I’ll go,” Nando volunteers. He steps into Ren’s back and reaches for the surface above. Ren lifts a little, and Nando squirms, shifting weight to his shoulders and forearms. Within seconds, he disappears into the upper chamber entirely.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Nando’s feet scuttle about, shuffling against the stony ground. Light dances around the chamber above, flitting back and forth as Nando takes in his new surroundings. “Well, that’s interesting,” he says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "His head reappears above us in the opening. “Check it out!” He holds a canteen above us, identical to the ones that were in our packs. Others have been here before. We must be close to the exit.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“That doesn’t make sense,” Dawn says. “We all have our canteens. How could there be one up there.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“No,” Ren says. “Not all of us do.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My stomach clenches. He’s right. That’s not just any canteen. That’s my canteen.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Chapter 7\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“It’s mine! But how’d that get up there?” I ask. “I threw it at the shadowman way back when it was chasing us.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Nando shakes his head. “I don’t see any signs of the shadowman. Looks completely safe up here. If it brought your canteen this way, it left it here and kept going. There’s light coming from the far side. The way out might be close. So maybe it left?” He points to the ground. “Throw my pack up.” Angaza scoops it and hoists it above.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Once Nando has his bag, he extends his arm down to help the next person, and we all take turns going up to the room above. When it’s time for me, I clasp Nando’s hand tightly in mine. He may be small of stature, but his grip is firm and secure. His forearm flexes as I place my rubber sole onto Ren’s back. Nando pulls, and my head emerges into the chamber above.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I place my arms on the cool surface and scramble up. I suck in a deep breath, the fresher air infiltrating my lungs and expelling the mustier stuff from below. But the cave’s walls seem to follow a pattern, and the ground is still relatively even, as though it were prepared like a path. Definitely the same cave.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The room tapers at the far side, funneling everything into a tunnel where a hint of light glows around the corner. That must be the light Nando mentioned. And the near side? Darkness, with only outlines of what lies hidden.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Nando nudges me. “Hey, Ginny! Your canteen.” I accept it back—still mostly full—and clip it onto my backpack.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Each of us ascend until only Ren remains below. “All right, help me up,” he says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn kneels next to Nando. “Wait,” she says. Nando pauses and looks to her, eyebrows furrowed.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Guys?” Ren says, his voice quivering. My muscles tighten.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn’s hair hangs over the opening, her gaze fixed below. She turns to Nando with a smile. “There’s nobody else down there to push him up while you pull. If we each grab a hand, it’ll be easier.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Nando nods. “Okay.” They both reach down and hoist Ren up through the opening. He puts the weight of his torso onto the ground and climbs the rest of the way through on his own. I take a deep breath, my muscles relaxing. It was nothing.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren rests on the ground, his gaze instantly drawn to the curved funnel with a faint light peeking around the bend.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Opposite the funnel is chaotic and uneven—a true cave, natural and untamed. No obvious path runs through the dark side, but there are a dozen black crevices that could form tunnels we can’t see from here. A shudder ripples down my spine.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Nando meanders along the edge of the dark side, swinging his light around with a bounce in his step.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "He’s humming. Is he crazy?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Let’s go,” Dawn says. My pulse races—I’m not exploring those unknown crevices. \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Nando, come on.” Dawn points at the tip of the curving tunnel. I release another long breath I didn’t know I was holding. Nando grunts and joins the rest of us. I file into line behind Ilma to make sure I’m not last.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "We parade up the path, following its gentle curve as it bends to the right. The farther we go, the more natural light illuminates the tunnel, splashing the brown rocks with vibrant oranges and reds. A whiff of tree sap floating along the air invites us to continue around the bend.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The end of the tunnel snakes into view with the promise of an endless azure sky. Dawn continues her steady march, but the rest of us break into a run. I find a spot at the mouth of the cave beside Ren and seize a deep breath. All of us do—except for Ilma, her eye narrowed as she stares breathlessly out at the vista before us.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "It’s a cliff.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The ledge drops off into fog, obscuring visibility farther than a hundred feet. The sky is all clear, with a beautiful blue. But the ground—who can say how far it is? And here I thought we were in the depths of the earth. All this time, it was a mountain—one that towers over a blanket of fog extending into the horizon.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I take another deep breath, but as I exhale, my stomach twists into my lungs. Getting out of the cave was the goal this whole time. But where are the shuttle drones? Where are the pole beacons? Where are the devices with sat-fi connection?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Where is civilization?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Where are we?” I ask, turning to the others. Angaza’s eyes stare back at me, no longer shining but rather large, dark spheres. I clutch my backpack’s straps and gasp, but Angaza only puts his head down and looks away. The others, however, fidget in place while they exchange glances.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“That’s a difficult question to answer,” Ren says. “I think for now, we should just worry about getting down.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "A cool breeze churns the fog below. The ledge drops to sheer rock all the way down. There isn’t an easy way off this cliff. Answering my stupid question would be much easier.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“We all know the way down, no? We’re equipped for it,” Nando says.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Into fog?” Dawn asks. “Sounds a little risky where we can’t see too far ahead.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Maybe there’s another way out?” Angaza suggests.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren sighs. “Maybe.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ilma points back into the cave. “It looks like there were some other tunnels back there in the darkness. We could see if one leads to a different exit.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn nods, her finger tracing that invisible line on her face. “And who knows how much of the lower level we didn’t get to.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“What if this cliff is only here to confuse us?” Gregory says. “What if we aren’t supposed to go this way?”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Dawn drops her hand back down and does a one-eighty to face the cave once more. “Let’s figure this out before we jump into idiotic decisions like we did earlier.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren’s back straightens, but he continues facing the piercing blue sky and velvety ocean of fog.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Buzzing murmurs through the air. My eyes dart in every direction. A drone after all? No, the sky remains as empty as ever, but the sound gets louder. Behind me. The buzz flickers into crackling static, not from the sky but from within the cave.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I pivot, placing my back to the fog. The shadowman emerges far on the other side of the bending tunnel, dragging its long cloak and keeping hidden any legs or feet. Its hood swivels just enough to face us directly.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“No!” Angaza shouts.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The shadowman raises both handless sleeves and breaks into a charge. A chorus of screams responds, and I’m the loudest.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“No choice, now,” Ilma says, “unless you want to face that thing directly. I don’t.” She crouches and  places both hands by her feet. As she stands, stretchy fabric extends to a cord that runs from her wrists to her ankles—yet another techsuit surprise. If that’s as sturdy as it looks, she’ll be able to glide down with it.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Jump, jump, jump!” Ren shouts.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Gregory and Angaza follow Ilma’s movements, transforming their techsuits into wingsuits, and all three of them jump off the ledge with yelps. The wind catches them, and they glide into the distance, eventually disappearing into the fog.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "My muscles tighten but refuse to move. Wingsuit gliding is dangerous enough for an experienced jumper in good conditions. I have no experience, and there’s no telling what terrain is hidden by the fog.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Nando lowers his posture and curls his hands into fists in front of him, but Dawn grabs his hands and yanks him into a crouching position.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Are you an idiot? We’re jumping, not fighting!” she shouts.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "He nods, and both of them stand back up with the cords and fabric in wingsuit formation. Nando jumps without a second’s hesitation, and Dawn soon follows.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "And me? I’m going to die. They’re leaving me to die.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "The shadowman shrieks, and I turn back to it. I stand transfixed on this physical manifestation of approaching doom. It’s only a few dozen feet away now, enveloped by light but still pitch black under that hood. \r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny!” It’s Ren.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I glance at him, tears streaming down my face. I know what he’s asking me to do even though all he says is my name. “I can’t; I can’t. I don’t know how. If I jump, I’ll crash.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Ren steps close, forcing deep breaths in and out. “Ginny, you can do this. The techsuit’s internal sensors will keep you at a good gliding level, and the fabric will deploy as a parachute when it senses ground approaching. The fog shouldn’t interfere with that.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Shouldn’t?” I gasp out.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“You will be okay,” Ren says as he holds either side of my face with his hands to calm me.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Memories instantly unlock within my mind, just like when I heard my name for the first time wandering in the cave. As a little girl, I’ddraw the same cat on my canvatab over and over. Something I hate is comparing crodus configs. And yes, I’ve used a wingsuit before.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "Most of my memories are still missing, and some of the details are still fuzzy. Just as I can remember my grandma’s cookie but not her face, I can remember jumping in a wingsuit with someone, but I can’t recall who. It’s—it’s a boy, someone special. We’re training for something important. But is it Ren? It must be. Who else could it be?\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "It doesn’t matter. I’ve done this before. I can do it again.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Ginny,” Ren says, bringing my focus back to the present. His gaze pierces mine. “Trust me.”\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "I nod vigorously. He holds my hands and guides them to my ankles, where my techsuit automatically engages its wingsuit mode, a cord attaching to my sleeve cuffs. As I stand, fabric stretches out and holds stiffly in place.\r\n" + 
    "\r\n" + 
    "“Jump!” Ren shouts, and we jump in unison, mere seconds before the shadowman arrives at the edge of the cliff.";
